      <description>These days it is so easy to tie ourselves up in knots with one simple word. Testing is something that ought to be a part of the fabric of the delivery cycle, the skein of the SDLC.

      <description>100% Coverage is only the beginning Code coverage gives us a solid foundation for delivery confidence, but it&amp;rsquo;s not the only way to boost delivery confidence. Confidence: the goal of a quality-focused delivery team. Code confidence is attained through rigorous and frequently repeated testing of the system against a raft of behavioural expectations.
These expectations form the specifications of the system and in fact document the system: both the functioning system, and the desires of the business that commissioned the system.</description>
