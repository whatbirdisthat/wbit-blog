Items such as &ldquo;nickname&rdquo;, &ldquo;favourite colour&rdquo; etc are stored in the external system (it doesn&rsquo;t matter how or where).</p><p>With transactional MFA implemented, changes to data are protected against naughtiness using multi-factor authentication. The second factor could be an SMS text, an authenticator app (such as Google Authenticator) or a one-time passcode sent to the user&rsquo;s email.</p><h3 id=read-or-compute-are-not-sensitive>READ or COMPUTE are not &lsquo;sensitive&rsquo;</h3><p>When applying transactional MFA, non-mutative actions are in general not protected using the second factor. An action such as, <code>view_account_balance</code> is not transactional, it is a VIEW. A calculated action, such as <code>estimated_gas_bill</code> won&rsquo;t need MFA either.</p><p>These actions are protected using the credentials factor alone. Username / password is considered to be sufficient protection for READ and COMPUTE operations, but a second factor is considered necessary to guard against potentially site-wide harm that may be caused by a bad actor exploiting a mutative process.</p><p>It depends entirely on the domain of course, a banking application may have much more strict requirements than a utility providing gas, electricity and internet or a fishing club.</p><h3 id=nonrepudiation-and-identity-binding>Nonrepudiation and identity binding</h3><p>The second factor will not provide complete protection but it will provide <em>added</em> protection.</p><p>A bad actor would have to have compromised both factors to gain access, which &mldr; <em>might be</em> less likely than the account owner being the perpetrator of the naughty thing.</p><div class="notices warning"><p>More identifying factors <em>should</em> increase the likelihood of a verified identity. But they <em>might</em> not.</p></div><p>In this case, the system is presenting a final alert, &ldquo;are you sure you want to do this?&rdquo;, as a warning <em>and</em> as a means of identification.</p><h3 id=one-time-mfa---still-a-threat>One time MFA - still a threat</h3><p>The diagram above describes a posture where convenience is still a high priority. A user may wish to perform multiple sensitive actions, but will only be challenged for the 2nd factor the first time. Subsequent sensitive actions are pre-authenticated on the 2nd factor.</p><p><img src=../images/Protecting-a-CHANGE-with-2FA.svg alt="Flow Diagram"></p><h3 id=three-tradeoffs-of-one-time-transactional-mfa>Three Tradeoffs of One Time Transactional MFA</h3><p>Security is relaxed somewhat for READ operations. Of course it is still possible to require a 2nd factor at any point, the system in question has chosen to apply them only to mutative actions.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Tradeoff</th><th>Status</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Security</td><td>The securedness of mutative operations is improved. At the time of the action, rather than at some time prior, the user is challenged to provide the 2nd factor. However, should a user authenticate with the 2nd factor, then walk away and leave their computer unlocked and the session open their account is just as open to attack as if they had provided the 2nd factor at login.</td></tr><tr><td>✅ <strong>Useability</strong></td><td>Useability is improved site-wide. For a user who does not want to perform mutative actions (such as VIEW their account balance) a single authentication factor is enough. Therefore, the user does not have to wait or fiddle about with obtaining and providing the 2nd factor.</td></tr><tr><td>Simplicity</td><td>Simplicity is foregone. In order to implement transactional MFA around only mutative actions, a lot of extra presentation logic is required. If there is no BFF the API itself must include challenge logic in every POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE that is exposed. There are ways to cross-cut this, but they are still complex / complicated.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id=all-ye-muste-mfa-the-things>All Ye Muste MFA the things</h3><p><img src=../images/Protecting-a-CHANGE-with-2FA-stateless.svg alt="Flow Diagram"></p><table><thead><tr><th>Tradeoff</th><th>Status</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>✅ <strong>Security</strong></td><td>If security is the highest concern, it makes sense to have every sensitive action protected by a MFA challenge. Making the system stateless in that sense will be very inconvenient for the user, as they will need to provide the 2nd factor every time they attempt a sensitive action but it will give the most clarity around who is attempting to perform the action.</td></tr><tr><td>Useability</td><td>Useability takes a back-seat to security in this configuration, and each and every time the user wants to perform a sensitive action they must deal with the hassle of providing the 2nd factor. There are some apps that make this easier - but security and convenience are mutually exclusive.</td></tr><tr><td>Simplicity</td><td>It&rsquo;s actually somewhat simpler to implement the stateless MFA for all sensitive actions as there is no requirement to check the state of 2nd factor - it&rsquo;s always in a state of &ldquo;not provided&rdquo; for this implementation</td></tr></tbody></table><hr><h4 id=the-trade-offs-are-clear-it-is-a-matter-of-posture-and-policy>The trade-offs are clear. It is a matter of posture and policy</h4><p>At the end of the day, to 2FA or not to 2FA is the question ultimately answered by the stakeholders - and the better equipped to make that decision they are, the more appropriate to the user base that decision will be.</p><p>As with everything, &ldquo;Ye Muste Use the MFA&rdquo; or &ldquo;MFA Suxe&rdquo; are extreme views, and more often than not the real-world answer is&mldr;.</p><p>There are other implementation concerns too. For example, considering certain RBAC grants are only available to MFA&rsquo;d consumers. Once the 2nd factor is presented, a raft of new permissions are available, similarly to how we might <code>sudo</code> or elevate our role permissions temporarily on a cloud platform.</p><h4 id=references>References</h4><p>Thank you to the writers of these articles:</p><p><a href=https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/12/19/multi-factor-authentication-sucks>Multi-Factor Authentication Sucks</a></p><p><a href=https://developer.okta.com/blog/2020/02/07/transactional-mfa>Never Build MFA Again: A Developer&rsquo;s Guide to Transactional MFA</a></p><p><a href="https://support.okta.com/help/s/article/Beginner-s-Guide-to-SAML?language=en_US">Beginner&rsquo;s Guide to SAML</a></p><p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization>Authorization - Wikipedia</a></p><footer class=footline></footer></div></div><div id=navigation></div></section><div style=left:-1000px;overflow:scroll;position:absolute;top:-1000px;border:none;box-sizing:content-box;height:200px;margin:0;padding:0;width:200px><div style=border:none;box-sizing:content-box;height:200px;margin:0;padding:0;width:200px></div></div><script src=/js/clipboard.min.js?1604653460></script><script src=/js/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1604653460></script><script src=/js/perfect-scrollbar.jquery.min.js?1604653460></script><script src=/js/jquery.sticky.js?1604653460></script><script src=/js/featherlight.min.js?1604653460></script><script src=/js/highlight.pack.js?1604653460></script><script>hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();</script><script src=/js/modernizr.custom-3.6.0.js?1604653460></script><script src=/js/learn.js?1604653460></script><script src=/js/hugo-learn.js?1604653460></script></body></html>
