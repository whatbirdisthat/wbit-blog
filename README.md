# The hugo site

## Preparing:

> using linux-brew on ubuntu

```bash
brew install hugo
```

> remember to make sure it is the 'extended' edition
> or there will be no SASS and etc

## Working with Hugo

```bash
hugo serve -D
```

## To add a post

```bash
hugo new posts/newpost.md
```

## To add style

> See the [mermaid example](./assets/sass/mermaid.scss)
> and the [html 'partial'](./layouts/partials/mermaid.html)

To get the theme to load the js and style I had to hack in
a partial on [the theme base html](./themes/m10c/layouts/_default/baseof.html)

## Embedding [mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io)

To embed the mermaid, see the [mermaid examples](content/posts/mermaid-examples.md)

Amplify is painful. It randomly borks.
