# Transitioning the Enterprise to the Cloud: A Business Approach

_by Edward Mahon_

> “An inconsistency exists between actual cloud adoption rates and the viewpoints and direct actions of those responsible for corporate information technology operations. On the one hand, information technology (IT) leaders generally believe the cloud more easily enables the implementation and management of technology services, from web and mobile application development to on-demand computing and storage. These leaders also appreciate the cloud’s consumption-based pricing model over their current capital-intensive cost structures.”
