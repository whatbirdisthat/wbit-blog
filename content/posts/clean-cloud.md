## A set of OKRs that can be easily assimilated into an enterprise IT culture

Enterprise IT is rife with litter.

There are EC2 instances running for months, called TEST001.

There are S3 buckets with no objects in them, that have no tags.

There are _entire features_ without a single automated test.

There are items of work that do not have adequate acceptance criteria.

There are overprovisioned servers, long-running environments, bloated taxonomies ...

Our clouds are not clean.

The Clean Cloud foundation relies on three core things:

1. Test EVERYTHING to provide PROOF that it WORKS and is FIT FOR PURPOSE
2. Automate EVERYTHING to provide healthy, right-sized infrastructure
3. Continuously search for, identify, and eliminate WASTE.

## On Point 1 - CONFIDENCE

The collaboration between the business and IT has been reported to be unhealthy
time and again - the business does not trust IT, "IT should be the ENABLER", and
this is truest when the business cannot act natively in the marketplace because
their IT workloads are buggy, slow, unresponsive, expensive, unreliable - etc.

### Build CONFIDENCE by providing rigorous, repeatable PROOF to the business that the software they WANT is the software they GOT

## On Point 2 - RISK

Variation and unpredictability are key components driving up operational and even
profit risk all over enterprise IT. When automated processes fail - they fail as
SOFTWARE, thus they can be FIXED like software. The failure occurs, a test is written
which proves the failure, then a fix is applied which passes the test. This method
of RISK DRAINING and FAILURE REMOVAL is guaranteed to produce dependable infrastructure
from front-end widgets to entire Line Of Business stacks that eventually cover the
vast majority of failure modes through the application of EXPERIENCE-DRIVEN evolution.

The pace of that eventuality is a decision to be made by the business, and by IT.
The more attention paid to reducing risk, the more risk is removed using this method.

## On Point 3 - WASTE

This is key. Waste occurs everywhere EVERYWHERE in the enterprise. From the coders
participating in the latest new features to the leadership making decisions without
adequate or appropriate measures and monitoring. There are "types of waste", and
every participant in the enterprise should be familiar with them, be vigilant for them
and raise their identification of them at the earliest opportunity.

Retrospectives are one way the capital-A Agile people address waste. Education on
how best to identify and eliminate waste is one of the most powerful tools available
to the enterprise to reduce spend, increase velocity, and correct their strategic
course.
