title: "Xero Cover Letter"

I used Xero for a bit to handle some accounting for my sole trader stuff last year. I really liked it. The UI is simple, clean and straight-forward. I read an article recently about hiring policy, "why we hire any kind of programmer". This resonates with me because I identify with the word "programmer" (as opposed to "developer" or "engineer").

I like programming. I know a few languages, and I pinch myself regularly to make sure that it really isn't a dream: I really am getting paid to play on my computer! (haha by "play" I don't mean, play Quake or whatever I mean solve puzzles with code)

I would like to talk to some humans at Xero and find out if things are fundamentally still the same as nine years ago when the "hire any kind of programmer" post was written, and to see if we could play D&D together (whoops I mean, do Agile/Scrum together) -- find out things like, "is quality non-negotiable?" and "do we pair?" and "do we deliver continuously?" etc.

I like docker, I use Manjaro/i3 and I have loved c# since 2000's ... C# is my favourite language but it isn't my only language. I just love doin' it. I have a lot of AWS exposure but still don't have a cert. I have a few containers in my GitHub repo - things like "git identities" or "FROM scratch to python in 14.9mb" ...

So, here's my CV, I hope we get a chance to chat - and maybe there's some work I can do for/with you :)
