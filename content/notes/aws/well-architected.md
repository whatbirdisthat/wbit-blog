## Amazon Well-Architected Framework

[Top level PDF](/whitepapers/AWS_Well-Architected_Framework.pdf)

### The Five Pillars of a Well-Architected Solution:

1. [Resillient](/whitepapers/AWS-Reliability-Pillar.pdf)
2. [Performant](/whitepapers/AWS-Performance-Efficiency-Pillar.pdf)
3. [Secure](/whitepapers/AWS-Security-Pillar.pdf)
4. [Cost-Optimised](/whitepapers/AWS-Cost-Optimization-Pillar.pdf)
5. [Operationally Excellent](/whitepapers/AWS-Operational-Excellence-Pillar.pdf)

Each pillar of the Well-Architected framework constitutes
a domain of the Solutions Architect - Associate exam.

| Domain                                          | % of Examination |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Design _Resillient_ Architectures               | 34%              |
| Define _Performant_ Architectures               | 24%              |
| Specify _Secure_ Applications and Architectures | 26%              |
| Design _Cost-Optimised_ Architectures           | 10%              |
| Define _Operationally Excellent_ Architectures  | 6%               |
